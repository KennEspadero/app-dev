  ## Description ##
The Maze Runner is based on a book by James Dashner of the same title published in 2009, and it’s your typical “young people trying to outwit an authoritarian regime” story. In The Maze Runner, a group of 50 amnesiac boys live in a clearing (called the Glade; they’re called Gladers) that is in turn surrounded by an intricate maze. Roaming around the maze are Grievers — half goopy spider, half machine creatures — which can kill you. The boys refer to the people watching them as the “Creators.”

  ## Plot ##
  
 Thomas (Dylan O'Brien), a teenager, arrives in a glade at the center of a giant labyrinth. Like the other youths dumped there before him, he has no memory of his previous life. Thomas quickly becomes part of the group and soon after demonstrates a unique perspective that scores him a promotion to Runner status -- those who patrol the always-changing maze to find an escape route. Together with Teresa (Kaya Scodelario), the only female, Thomas tries to convince his cohorts that he knows a way out.
